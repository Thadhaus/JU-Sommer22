This is the corresponding repository to my

[Textadventure on repl.it](https://replit.com/@GeduldigeBirne/Textadventure)

I use repl.it for my programming courses to teach some Python programming.
It is simple but powerful and it runs in a webbrowser, which is 
available virtually on every device nowadays.

Its main purpose is to show the use of [github](https://github.com) with
[repl.it](https://replit.com).


Remark:  This is not the newest version available. In other versions some bugs have been fixed. There is also a german translation available.
